# The-Elliptic-Curve-Digital-Signature-Algorithm-ECDSA
The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is a cryptographic algorithm used to create and verify digital signatures. It is based on the mathematics of elliptic curves and is used in many applications where security and authentication are important, such as in the banking industry, e-commerce, and digital identity systems.
